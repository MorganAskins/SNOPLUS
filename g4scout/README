----------------------Scout Geant4 Simulations-----------------------------

The SCOUT (Scintillation Counter of Uranium / Thorium) detector simulations
is designed as a 1 m^3 liquid scintillator detector with a copper, borated-poly,
lead shield. The detector volume is broken into three modules with three pmts
per side per module (totalling 18 pmts).

Note: I will not list changes/updates here. Use 'git log' for that.

Prerequisites for installation:
GNUmake
Geant4
ROOT
Python

:: BUILDING ::
To make simply type 'make' in this directory. As long as your Geant4 and ROOT
environment variables are configured correctly there should be no further steps.

:: RUNNING ::
The compiler will add the program 'Scout' to your geant4 path.
When run on its own Scout will load macros/initInter.mac to show the detector
geometry and place the user in interactive mode.
In Batch mode the user can run 'Scout name_of_macro.mac'

:: MACROS ::
All of the macros are kept in the macros directory. There are several included
macros, of which template.mac contains a simple macro example with all of the
different options shown and commented. Use this as a template if you aren't sure
which commands can be run with the simulation software.

:: OUTPUT ::
Currently the default output format is in ROOT.
TODO:: Add another output format (JSON maybe ...)

:: OUTPUT FORMAT (ROOT) ::
TODO:: Put root tree structure here

:: GENERATORS ::
TODO:: Put list of generators here
